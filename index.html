           <p>Hello, my name is Kyleen Hunter. I am 19 years old and I am in school for software devolpement. I have two cats named Luna and Rowena, I also have a Harry Potter tattoo on my right forearm(I really like Harry Potter). I live in Vancouver, Washington and hoping to move to Orlando, Florida soon. I love to read fantasy rommance novels and my favorite tv show is Friends. I have one niece and two nephews who I adore, I like to play Lego Marvel on my switch with them. Being an Aunt is the best thing in the world!! Below are some of my favorite temples. Below are links to the Portland,Oregon Temple, Orlando, Florida Temple and the San Diego, California Temple.</p>

            <h2>Washington</h2>

            <p>Vancouver, Washington, is on the border between Oregon and Washington. With a sales tax free state just across the river, it makes big purchases much cheaper. Vancouver residents tend to use the Portland, Oregon, airport as means of travel. We have lots of homelessness, lock your doors! They also like to take your garbage as means of income, if you like soda like my family your house could also be a gold mine. Can you see why we're trying to move?</p>
